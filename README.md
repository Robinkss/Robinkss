## About me

Software engineer, graduated from Polytech Montpellier.

Three principles guide my daily work: Patience, Perseverance, and Discipline. I am convinced that by adhering to these principles, it is possible to achieve goals that once seemed unattainable.

I am passionate about software development, and more specifically, the design of reliable and high-performing systems. To this end, I draw upon all the courses I took during my studies as well as my professional experiences.

I also pay particular attention to the art direction and user interfaces of the products I design. I want a system to be reliable and efficient, and even more so, it must be pleasant to use and memorable.

In parallel, a passion that grows stronger every day is music. It allows me to express my creativity, often contained within studies where science is the cornerstone. I started by playing guitar, and I'm currently moving towards composing music using a computer, gradually building my own home studio.

I'm currently training in functional programming paradigms, particularly for a personal project that's very important to me.

## Current project 
The project in question :)

With a friend, we've embarked on creating a music and social platform dedicated to independent artists. Our idea is to offer an alternative to current solutions by providing fairer compensation and fostering closer connections between artists and their community. We also strive for transparency in how we handle the data of our future users. We also aim to have complete control over our data, for example, by developing our own AI to create a recommendation algorithm.
This project will soon be launched on GitHub (we're starting a migration from GitLab to GitHub). You can follow its progress; updates will be posted on my LinkedIn.
